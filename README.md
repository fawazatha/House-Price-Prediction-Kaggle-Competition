# House Price Prediction Kaggle Competition (top 5%)
This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive solution to the Kaggle competition, "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." The primary objective of this competition is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates the sale price of residential properties. Through extensive data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, my goal is to create a high-performing model capable of providing precise predictions for house sale prices.
