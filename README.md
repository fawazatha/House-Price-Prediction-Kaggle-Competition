# House Price Prediction Kaggle Competition (top 5%)
This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive solution to the Kaggle competition, "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." The primary objective of this competition is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates the sale price of residential properties. Through extensive data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, my goal is to create a high-performing model capable of providing precise predictions for house sale prices.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition, "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." It comprises a training set and a test set. The training set consists of a diverse range of houses with known sale prices, while the test set includes houses without the sale price information.

## ## Approach
My approach for solving the house price prediction problem involved the following steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: I conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable. This involved visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis.
2. Feature Engineering: I handled missing data by applying appropriate imputation techniques. My approach to handle missing values involve in the following strategies:
   • For continuous variables: I replaced missing values with the median value of each category, considering a relevant categorical variable. If a missing value was expected in the variable, I replaced it with 0.
   • For categorical variables: I examined the distribution of values using the value_counts method. If there were values without negative meanings (such as NA or POOL), I replaced them with None. Additionally, for categorical variables related to specific categories, I identified the distribution of values within 
     each category and replaced the least common value with a more suitable alternative.
